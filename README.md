lac1.py
================

This is a simple python interface to the LAC-1 controller produced by SMAC US.
Note that the home function is specifically aimed at a LCS25-025-xx-x stage,
and should not be used without inspection. It is extremely unlikely to work for
any setup other than mine.

bench.py
==================

This is a simple program excercise the various functions and to gain an idea
of how maximum velocity and acceleration settings affect the travel time.
